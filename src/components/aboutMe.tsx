        <p className="text-lg">
          I am deeply passionate about web development not just as a career, but
          as a way to bring ideas to life. There is something incredibly
          exciting about building products that people can actually use, and I
          find joy in every part of the process — from planning and
          problem-solving to polishing the final user experience. I am the kind
          of person who gets lost in flow when coding, always curious to explore
          how things work under the hood. I love the challenge of solving logic
          puzzles, improving performance, and learning something new every day.
          To me, development is a creative outlet — a space where logic meets
          imagination. Whether it is a small detail that enhances usability or a
          big feature that brings value, I care deeply about what I create. I am
          always seeking better ways to build and more meaningful problems to
          solve.
